# parks-and-weather-app

##Description
This is a United States national park trip planner webpage created by group 1 in the KU Coding Bootcamp.  This page utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, interfaces with the NPS API and OpenWeather API, and incorporates the jQuery and Foundation libraries.  It allows the user to find a list of US national parks located within a specified state, and upon selecting a park, the user is redirected to a park page that displays a 5 day weather forecast and detailed park information.  

##User Story
As a USER, I want to find a national park in a state I'm traveling to, and learn what I can do and how the weather looks.

SO THAT

WHEN I search a state name
THEN I am presented with a list of national parks in that state

WHEN I select the park I want to go to
THEN I am redirected to a new page specific to the park selected

WHEN I view the park page
THEN I see a 5 day weather forecast for that park's location

WHEN I view the park page
THEN I see a group of park details including a brief park description, hours of operation, and any entry fees.

WHEN I click a back button on the park page
THEN I am redirected back to the main state search page
